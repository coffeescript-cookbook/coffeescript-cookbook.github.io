h2. Problem

You need to convert between radians and degrees.

h2. Solution

Use Javascript's Math.PI and a simple formula to convert between the two.

{% highlight coffeescript %}
# To convert from radians to degrees
radiansToDegrees = (radians) ->
    degrees = radians * 180 / Math.PI

# To convert from degrees to radians
degreesToRadians = (degrees) ->
    radians = degrees * Math.PI / 180
{% endhighlight %}
