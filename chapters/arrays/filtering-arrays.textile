h2. Problem

You want to be able to filter arrays based on a boolean condition.

h2. Solution

Extend the Array prototype to add a filter function which will take a callback and perform a comprension over itself, collecting all elements for which the callback is true.

{% highlight coffeescript %}
# Extending Array's prototype
Array::filter = (callback) ->
  element for element in this when callback(element)

array = [1..10]

# Filter odd elements
filtered_array = array.filter (x) -> x % 2 == 0
# => [2,4,6,8,10]

# Filter elements less than or equal to 5:
gt_five = (x) -> x > 5
filtered_array = array.filter gt_five
# => [6,7,8,9,10]
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Discussion

This is similair to using ruby's Array#select method.
